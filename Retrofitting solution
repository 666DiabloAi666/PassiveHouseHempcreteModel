Wet floodproofing is often used when all other 
mitigation techniques are technically infeasible or are 
too costly. Wet floodproofing is generally appropriate if 
a structure has available space where damageable items 
can be stored temporarily. Utilities and furnaces may 
need to be relocated or protected along with other non-
movable items with flood damage-resistant building 
materials. Wet floodproofing may also be appropriate 
for structures with basements and crawlspaces that 
cannot be protected technically or cost-effectively by 
other retrofitting measures.
Compared with the more extensive flood protection measures described in this manual, wet floodproofing 
is generally the least expensive. The major costs of this measure involve the rearrangement of utility systems, 
installation of flood damage-resistant materials, acquisition of labor and equipment to move items, and 
organization of cleanup when floodwaters recede. Major disruptions to structure occupancy often result 
during conditions of flooding.
Table 2 in FEMA’s NFIP Technical Bulletin 2-08, Flood Damage-Resistant Materials Requirements for 
Buildings Located in Special Flood Hazard Areas in accordance with the National Flood Insurance Program
(FEMA, 2008a), provides class ratings with regards to flood damage-resistance for standard construction 
materials. It needs to be noted, however, that the materials are deemed “acceptable” and “unacceptable” 
for use below the BFE in a SFHA within the confines of the NFIP. The NFIP does not allow for wet 
floodproofing for new and substantially damaged or improved residential structures located in a SFHA.
Table 1-4 provides advantages and disadvantages associated with wet floodproofing a home.
