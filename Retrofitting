1.3.1.1 Elevation on Solid Perimeter Foundation Walls
Elevation on solid perimeter foundation walls is normally used 
in areas of low to moderate water depth and velocity. After the 
structure is raised from its current foundation, the support 
walls can often be extended vertically using materials such as 
concrete masonry units (CMU) or cast-in-place concrete. Figure 
1-1 shows an elevation on solid perimeter foundation walls and 
Figure 1-2 shows a home elevated on extended foundation 
walls. The structure is then set down on the extended walls. 
While this may seem to be the easiest solution to the problem 
of flooding, there are several important considerations.
Depending on the structure and potential environmental loads (such as flood, wind, seismic, and snow), new, 
larger footings may have to be constructed. It may be necessary to reinforce both the footings and the walls 
using steel reinforcing bars to provide needed structural stability.
Deep floodwaters can generate loads great enough to collapse the structure regardless of the materials used. 
Constructing solid foundation walls with openings or vents will help alleviate the danger by allowing 
hydrostatic forces to be equalized on both sides. For new and substantially damaged or improved buildings, 
flood openings are required under the NFIP.

Flood: Elevating Your Floodprone 
House (FEMA, 2000), for details

structures.
