that mimics the gridded earth decomposition of general circulation models in Matlab
(Appendix C).
3 Model configuration
The model configuration presented below is the ECCO v4 setup used in state estima-
5 tion (Sects. 4 and 5) and based on the LLC90 grid (Sect. 2). Variants of the ECCO
v4 setup are also used in un-optimized model simulations (Danabasoglu et al., 2014;
Marshall et al., 2014). The setup uses fully supported options of MITgcm software, is
archived and regularly benchmarked (Appendix F), and is freely available along with
the MITgcm itself (Sect. “Code availability”).
10 The MITgcm, as configured in ECCO v4, solves the hydrostatic, Boussinesq equa-
tions (Marshall et al., 1997) using the z
∗
rescaled height vertical coordinate (Adcroft
and Campin, 2004) and the vector-invariant form of the momentum equation (Adcroft
et al., 2004a). This latter choice yields a discretized momentum equation without metric
terms, which simplifies the handling of elaborate grids such as LLC90 (Sect. 2). This
15 section summarizes the model equations, settings, and new MITgcm features (MITgcm
Group, 2002; Adcroft et al., 2004b) used in ECCO v4. The novelty here largely resides
in additions of forward model features to the body of adjointed codes (Sect. 4) and in
their use in the state estimate (Sect. 5). Table 1 provides a list of basic model settings.
The relative importance of various model settings generally depends on the ocean
20 state characteristic of interest. Here, a selection of ocean state characteristics is made
amongst model-data differences (see Sect. 4), monthly time series of global mean
quantities, and meridional transports (Table 2). These characteristics are used to gauge
perturbations of 20 year solutions to various model settings (Table 3). They are also
used to benchmark state estimate re-runs and model revisions (first 3 rows of Table 3;
25 Appendix F) and to gauge the sensitivity of the state estimate to adjusted control pa-
rameters (Sect. 5).
