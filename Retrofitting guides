1.5.1 Other Retrofitting Guides
When considering retrofitting a structure, it is important to approach the retrofitting method selection 
and design process with a multi-hazard perspective. Improvements to a building that are made to increase 
resistance to the effects of natural hazards should focus on those items that will potentially return the largest 
benefit to the building owner. If the existing building is considered inadequate to resist natural hazard loads, 
retrofit improvements should be considered for the following building elements:
 Decks and porches
 Exterior metal (handrails, connectors, etc.)
 Windows and doors
 Foundation
 Exterior equipment 
 Roof
 Siding
All relevant hazards to the home need be considered. FEMA has several other retrofit publications available:
 NFIP Technical Bulletins 1 through 11 (available at http://www.fema.gov/plan/prevent/floodplain/
techbul.shtm)
 FEMA P-312, Homeowner’s Guide to Retrofitting (FEMA, 2009a)
 FEMA 232, Homebuilder’s Guide to Earthquake-Resistant Design and Construction (FEMA, 2006a)
 FEMA 347, Above the Flood: Elevating Your Floodprone House (FEMA, 2000a)
 FEMA P-348, Protecting Building Utilities from Flood Damage: Principles and Practices for the Design and 
Construction of Flood Resistant Building Utility Systems (FEMA, 1999a)
 FEMA 356, Prestandard and Commentary for the Seismic Rehabilitation of Buildings (FEMA, 2000b) 
later replaced by ASCE 41-06, Seismic Rehabilitation of Existing Buildings (ASCE, 2006)
 FEMA P-499, Home Builder’s Guide to Coastal Construction (FEMA, 2010a)
 Technical Fact Sheet Number 9.1: “Repairs, Remodeling, Additions, and Retrofitting – Flood”
 Technical Fact Sheet Number 9.2: “Repairs, Remodeling, Additions, and Retrofitting – Wind”
 FEMA P-804, Wind Retrofit Guide for Residential Buildings (FEMA, 2010b)
Chapter 15 of FEMA P-55, Coastal Construction Manual (FEMA, 2011) also discusses retrofit options and 
solutions for different hazards, as well as the importance of retrofitting with a multi-hazard perspective.
An engineer or design professional should be consulted to ensure that a retrofit project for one hazard type 
will not impede the structure’s resistance to other types of natural hazards.
