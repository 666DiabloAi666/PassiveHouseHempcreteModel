-opments in the context of ECCO v4. Aside from the dynamical model (Sects. 2 and 3)
the defining ingredients of state estimation are model-data constraints and control pa-
rameters. Their ECCO v4 implementation and specifications are covered in Sects. 4.3
and 4.4.
5 The state estimate (Sect. 5) is a solution of the forward model (Sects. 2 and 3) at
an approximate minimum of J. The process of finding such solutions, typically through
an iterative optimization process and using the adjoint model, is not a focus of this
paper. A number of well known optimization methods, with third party implementations
freely available online, can be used to this end (see, e.g. Heimbach et al., 2005, and
10 references therein).
Note that the existence of a unique global minimum of J is only rigorously established
for linear least squares, when it can be solved for in matrix form to machine precision.
In contrast, for non-linear inverse problems7
one can only aim to find at least one
approximate minimum of J that is an acceptable fit to the data (i.e. a fit within specified
15 errors).

The degree of non-linearity may depend on the process of interest and increases substan-
tially upon inclusion of meso-scale eddies.
