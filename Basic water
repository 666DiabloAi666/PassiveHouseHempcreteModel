For a water column that extends from the bottom at z = −H to the free surface at z = η,
the z
∗
vertical coordinate is defined as z = η+s
∗
z
∗ with the scaling factor s
∗ = 1+η/H. In
this section, the notation ∇z
∗ indicates the nabla operator at constant z
∗
, i.e., in a plane
of constant z
∗
value. The z
∗
5 coordinate set of equations was introduced by Adcroft and
Campin (2004) (their Eqs. 9–11 and 13). Written in vector-invariant formulation they
read:

For practical reason, the vertical velocity calculated by the model (w per Eq. 3) is neither
the z

vertical velocity w
∗
nor the true vertical velocity that would contain additional contributions
(Adcroft and Campin, 2004, see their Eq. 4).
