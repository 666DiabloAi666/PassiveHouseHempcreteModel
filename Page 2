lute ocean circulation from synoptic, ship-based, hydrography transects. The physical
model combined thermal-wind shear (diagnosed from observations) and a continuity
equation. The model parameter to be estimated (i.e. the control vector) was the “ref-
erence level velocity”. Least squares provide an adequate formulation to this inverse
5 problem, and a practical method to avoid mis-interpreting geophysical noise (synoptic
eddies, internal waves, etc.) for time mean ocean circulation features (Wunsch, 1977).
The original implementation has been extended substantially over subsequent
decades, and some of the key technical developments are worth recalling (see also
Wunsch and Heimbach, 2013a, for a review of the state of the art), as they provide
10 the context for the present work. Non-linearities were introduced (Mercier, 1986) to
incorporate optimal interpolation of hydrographic data in the inverse problem. While
diapycnal and horizontal diffusion were also introduced early on (Schott and Zantopp,
1980; Olbers et al., 1985), the need for extending the inversion problem to parameter-
ized advective eddy transports (Gent and Mcwilliams, 1990) was not fully appreciated
15 until the study of Ferreira et al. (2005).
Time dependency and the use of Lagrange multipliers (i.e. the adjoint method) were
first introduced in ocean inverse modeling by Thacker and Long (1988) and Holland
and Malanotte-Rizzoli (1989) and applied to general circulation models by Tziperman
and Thacker (1989) and Tziperman et al. (1992a, b). Later on algorithmic differentiation
20 (AD) was introduced, making the use of Lagrange multipliers more practical (Griewank,
1992; Giering and Kaminski, 1998). Its application (Marotzke et al., 1999; Heimbach
et al., 2002, 2005) to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology general circulation
model (MITgcm; Marshall et al., 1997; Adcroft et al., 2004b) allowed for implementation
of the time varying non-linear inverse problem, as envisioned by Wunsch and Minster
25 (1982) and Wunsch (1984), to the case of actual observations (Stammer et al., 2002;
Ferron and Marotzke, 2003).
The MITgcm AD capabilities remain exceptional amongst general circulation models.
Over the last decade, in the context of the Estimating the Circulation and Climate of
the Ocean (ECCO) project, the MITgcm non-linear inverse modeling framework (using
