1 INTRODUCTION TO RETROFITTING
Levees are generally limited to homes where floodwaters are less 
than 5 feet deep. Otherwise, the cost and the land area required 
for such barriers usually make them impractical for the average 
owner.
Special design considerations must be taken into account when 
floodwalls or levees are used to protect homes with basements 
because they are susceptible to seepage that can result in 
hydrostatic and saturated soil pressure on foundation elements.
The costs of floodwalls and levees can vary greatly, depending on height, length, availability of construction 
materials, labor, access closures, and the interior drainage system. A levee could be constructed at a lower cost 
if the proper fill material is available nearby.
Table 1-5 provides advantages and disadvantages associated with protecting a home with a floodwall 
or a levee.
NOTE
Provisions for closing access 
openings must be included as 
part of the floodwall or levee 
design.
Table 1-5. Advantages and Disadvantages of Floodways and Levees
Advantages Disadvantages
Protects the area around the structure from 
inundation without significant changes to the 
structure
Does not satisfy the NFIP requirements for bringing 
substantially damaged or improved structures into 
compliance
Eliminates pressure from floodwaters that would 
cause structural damage to the home or other 
structures in the protected area
May fail or be overtopped by large floods or floods of 
long duration
Costs less to build than elevating or relocating the 
structure
May be expensive
Allows the structure to be occupied during 
construction
Requires periodic maintenance
Reduces flood risk to the structure and its contents Requires interior drainage 
Reduces the physical, financial, and emotional 
strains that accompany flood events
May affect local drainage, possibly resulting in water 
problems for others
Does not reduce flood insurance premiums
May restrict access to structure
Requires considerable land (levees only)
Does not eliminate the need to evacuate during floods
May require warning and human intervention for 
closures
May violate applicable codes or regulations
