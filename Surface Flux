) which is zero in the absence of seaice and salinity
relaxation (see Sect. 3.5).
With the non-linear free-surface, the water column thickness varies as the free-
surface goes up and down (as apparent in Eqs. 7–9). With the z
∗
coordinate, this
variation is distributed vertically over all grid-cells5

equation (Eq. 7) also through Rη
−H
dz renders the free-surface non-linear; furthermore,
time dependent grid-cell thickness introduces many more non-linearities which re-
quired code modifications to ensure efficient adjoint code generation via AD (Sect. 4.2).
Earlier ECCO configurations relied on the linear free-surface method (LFS), where
10 column thickness and grid-cell thickness are fixed in time. The LFS version of Eqs. (7)
and (9) is:

The Goldsbrough–Stommel circulation (Stommel, 1984) can be accounted for by set-
15 ting FW = 1 (virtual fresh-water) or ignored (FW = 0). However, since grid-cell thick-
ness is held fixed with LFS, the dilution effect due to surface freshwater flux needs
to be represented explicitly as a virtual salt flux (2nd term in Eq. 11) using either the
local surface salinity S or a constant So as Se, with drawbacks in both cases (see, e.g.,
Campin et al., 2008). By contrast, the non-linear free-surface formulation incorporates
20 the dilution effect very naturally, within the time derivative of the water-column salt con-
tent (first term in Eq. 9).
