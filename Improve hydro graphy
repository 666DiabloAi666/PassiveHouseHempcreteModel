5.2 Improved hydrography fit
In developing and producing the state estimate, a primary goal was to improve the fit
5 to observed in situ profiles (of T and S) as compared with earlier ECCO estimates (see
Forget, 2010). As already apparent in Table 3, the inclusion of parameterized physics
as controls (i.e. adjustable model parameters) was instrumental in achieving that goal.
The present section focuses on this defining characteristic of the baseline ECCO v4
solution.
10 The fit to in situ profiles of temperature and salinity is depicted in Fig. 9 as a function
of time, for ECCO v4 and earlier MITgcm solutions. For ECCO v4 the model-data
distance for in situ profiles (see Sect. 4.3) is jT ≈ 1.5 for potential temperature and
jS ≈ 1.5 for salinity (on average over all depths, locations and times). Average values
of 1 would be ideal if the error estimate (see Forget and Wunsch, 2007) was perfect
15 and the state estimate was devoid of large scale errors (neither of which is true). It is
suspected that jT and jS could be further reduced. Values of 1.5, however, are regarded
as sufficiently low to justify analysis of the state estimate water masses (Speer and
Forget, 2013) and stratification (Forget, 2015b). Furthermore, jT and jS are already
much reduced (by a factor of 2 to 10) compared with earlier ECCO estimates (Fig. 9)
20 throughout the period from 1992 to 2011. Amongst earlier ECCO estimates, the ECCO
v3 solution comes the closest to the observed hydrography with a typical distance to
observations of 3 (Fig. 9).
The contrasts in jT and jS amongst solutions (Fig. 9) reflect large scale misfits as
illustrated in Fig. 10. This is equally true for ECCO2 eddying solutions (bottom panels)
25 and for coarser model solutions (top and middle panels). Such broad misfit patterns
typically denote spurious model drifts and biases, which are common symptoms of
model deficiencies (Stammer, 2005; Ferreira et al., 2005). Similarities in misfit patterns
amongst ECCO2 eddying solutions (using a common model set-up, under different sets
