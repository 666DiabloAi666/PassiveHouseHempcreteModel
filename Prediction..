For problems as massive as ECCO v4 (see Tables 5–7), full error covariance matri-
ces are impractical and will remain so for the foreseeable future. Matrix free approaches
are of great practical value in this context. For example, the method of Weaver and
Courtier (2001) is used in ECCO v4 to specify control parameter adjustment scales
5 (Sect. 4.4) and penalize large-scale model-data misfits (Forget and Ponte, 2015).
Within pure linear least-squares theory, under the unrealistic assumption of perfect
error covariance specifications, multipliers αi
, βj
should be omitted from Eq. (12). They
are, however, adequate in practice as a means to partly compensate for approxima-
tions in error covariances, and the neglect of Ri non-diagonal terms in particular. They
10 also provide a practical means to accelerate the optimization of data sets introduced in
J during later stages of optimization. Furthermore, u
T
j
uj
(in Eq. 12) essentially are regu-
larization terms included to limit control parameters adjustments, and the βj multipliers
provide the corresponding trade-off parameters (Hansen, 1992).
4.2 Adjoint modeling
15 The method of Lagrange multipliers (i.e. the adjoint method) and its application to nu-
merical models being stepped forward in time is well documented elsewhere. In par-
ticular, the interested reader is referred to Thacker and Long (1988) for a succinct pre-
sentation, with application to the case of a simple wave equation. The fitting of model
sea level variability to altimetry through forcing adjustments estimated by the adjoint
20 method (see, e.g. Forget and Ponte, 2015) is analogous to the simple case treated in
Thacker and Long (1988). A crucial advantage of this method, as used in ECCO, is that
it avoids adding source/sink terms of unknown nature to the model equations8
. Adjoint
models have many useful applications in their own right, and we shall list a few that are
particularly relevant to ECCO.
8Note that this desirable property does not hold in the case of incremental (or sequential)
data assimilation schemes (whether or not using an adjoint model) but this is not a case of in-
terest here. In particular, it does not hold in 4DVar as practiced in numerical weather prediction.
